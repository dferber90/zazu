## Publishing new versions

Whenever you are ready to publish a new version, simply increment the version in `package.json`, and then run `yarn publish` and `yarn demo:publish`. Publishing a new version to npm is effective immediately, while publishing a new demo version to GitHub Pages can take 20 minutes or so to become effective.
